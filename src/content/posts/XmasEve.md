# Happy holidays!

Although prematurely, I want to wish everyone reading this a happy Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Yule, or whatever you respecively celebrate! Me personally, my family opens presents from eachother on Christmas eve, and then on Christmas day it is a nice celebration! 

## Some favorite memories

I have fond memories of many Christmases, from the time we all got sleds and immediately tore them up (we live in a foresty area) to when we would all sit by a fire and read books together. I hope that everyone is able to make some __wonderful__ memories this Christmas with your loved ones.

*Goodbye!* :D
